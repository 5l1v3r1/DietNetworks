# TODO list

- [ ] IMDb literature review, we don't get SOTA but does our model have less parameters? Do the other models suffer from decreasing the number of supervised samples?
- [x] Train the model using partially labeled subsets (10%, 25%, 50% ...): the model does not seem to suffer from using few labeled samples.

# Pending tasks
- [ ] Wait for Julie to share the 1000 genome dataset and wrap it.
- [ ] As a first step, run experiments with the proposed model to see how it performs at classifying the ethnicity of the a person from SNPs.


# Feature-Selection
Ackwnoledgement: we used scikit feature (added to the repo) for some of our baselines.
